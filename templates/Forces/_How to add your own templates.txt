## Forces Templates

The friendly/enemy forces templates available in the generator are simply .miz files in the Generator/Forces folder.

A Forces template defines the groups of ground units available, AI aircraft, liveries, and loadouts.

To create your own Forces template:

1) Create an empty mission on Caucasus 
2) Add ground unit groups.
3) Save the mission in this directory.

Optional:

4) Add helicopters with "CAS" main task for attack helicopters.
5) Add helicopters with "Transport" main task for transport helicopters.
6) Add planes with "CAS" main task for attack planes.
7) Add planes with "CAP" main task for fighters.
8) Configure loadouts, liveries, and skill for aircraft.

Tips:
- The mission generator will only extract blue ground units from the template when selected from the "Blue Forces" menu, and vice versa.
- Only unit types are used from ground units.  Liveries or other attributes are able to be copied.
- For aircraft, group size is currently capped at 2 units per group to help prevent issues with parking.  Only the first unit in the group is used as a source.
